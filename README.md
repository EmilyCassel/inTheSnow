## Description


## Motivation for Development
The motivation for development was to create an easy to use weather application that allows the user to easily click on a past searched city and see the coming weather on the same page as the current weather for easy life planning. 

## User Story
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Technologies Used: 
This project used the technologies of CSS, HTML, JS, dayjs and inquirer


## Challenges 
A challenge was trying to make the showCityForecast function. This was very difficult for me because my original approach did not work and I became overwhelmed. I met with the TA and he was able to bring me back on track. Another problem was that the citySearchHistory needed to be an array and was an object. This was fixed with object.values 


## Successes
The completing of the showCityForecast function was a success. Another success was getCurrentSearchCity and it working like the video we watched on how this worked. It took me a second I had a lowercase where I shouldnâ€™t but I found it and fixed it. 


## Directions for Future Development
Set it up so that only 7 cities are available to be seen in the local storage but that cites can be saved at the bottom of the page by pinning them onto a users page this may require a login
